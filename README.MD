### About this game

A 3D Game made with Unity Personal Edition.

I decided to take <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2">Ben Tristem's Unity 3D Course on Udemy</a> and I love it so far. My only personal gripe with it, is it feels a bit slow as someone who has a bit of experience with Unity. But I'm sticking with it since I've already learned a few things from it.

### Can I use your game's code?

Yes! Of Course! Do what you want with it!
